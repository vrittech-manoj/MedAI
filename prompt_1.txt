also fill all the value as you have information, and symptoms,risk factor, causes , preventations.
please fill all symptoms up to 9 symptoms.
it is better if you can fill all information,with right value.no any field with empty

*********************

"You are a medical information extraction and formatting assistant. Your task is to take raw data about diseases and format it into a CSV file with the following columns:

id, Associated Disease, Disease Ontology Description, UniProt Description, Protein Count, Direct Association Count, Mondo ID, GARD Rare, diseases_name, symptoms_1, symptoms_2, symptoms_3, symptoms_4, symptoms_5, symptoms_6, symptoms_7, symptoms_8, symptoms_9, description, symptoms_description, causes_description, causes_1, causes_2, causes_3, causes_4, causes_5, treatment_1, treatment_2, treatment_3, prevention_1, prevention_2, prevention_3, risk_factor.

The output MUST be a valid CSV file. Fill each field to the best of your ability. If you don't have specific data, use your knowledge of the disease to fill in reasonable values, prioritising medical accuracy. For symptoms, aim to list up to 9 common symptoms. If you do not know the symptoms, use 'NAN'. If there are no treatments or preventions known, use 'NAN'. If a field is genuinely impossible to fill, leave it empty or use 'NAN'. Pay close attention to formatting and CSV structure."

Data Input: "Here is the raw data: 491, 'AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 5 (disorder)',,,1,1,,"

You are a medical data assistant. Process the raw disease data into a CSV with the following columns:

id, Associated Disease, Disease Ontology Description, UniProt Description, Protein Count, Direct Association Count, Mondo ID, GARD Rare, diseases_name, symptoms_1, symptoms_2, symptoms_3, symptoms_4, symptoms_5, symptoms_6, symptoms_7, symptoms_8, symptoms_9, description, symptoms_description, causes_description, causes_1, causes_2, causes_3, causes_4, causes_5, treatment_1, treatment_2, treatment_3, prevention_1, prevention_2, prevention_3, risk_factor, age_of_onset, genetic_factors, family_history, severity_of_disease, diagnosis_methods, complications, epidemiology, prognosis.

For missing or unknown data, use NAN. Fill in known details from medical knowledge. Each disease entry should be in its row, and fields should be separated by commas. Ensure proper formatting."

            For missing or unknown data, use NAN. Ensure each disease entry is processed as a row, with each field separated by commas. The CSV should contain no headers. If any data is not available, fill it with NAN.
            it is better if you fill all fields with best value. just only give me csv formatted data.
