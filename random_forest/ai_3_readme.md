Looking at your error and the dataset analysis, I can see several issues with the disease prediction system:

Extreme class imbalance: 11,089 diseases have only 1 sample, which makes training impossible
No symptoms found: The system found 0 unique symptoms, indicating column naming issues
Zero variance features: All features are constant after preprocessing
SMOTE error: Can't apply SMOTE when there are no valid features

Let me create a fixed version of the disease prediction system that handles these issues:Fixed Disease Prediction SystemCodeÂ import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV, cross_val_score
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder, LabelEncodI've created a fixed version of your disease prediction system that addresses the major issues:
Key Improvements:
1. Better Dataset Inspection

Automatically analyzes the dataset structure to understand column names and content
Identifies text-based symptom columns vs structured data
Shows sample data to help debug issues

2. Flexible Feature Extraction

Structured approach: Looks for symptom/cause columns with various naming patterns
Text-based fallback: Uses TF-IDF vectorization when structured features aren't available
Multiple extraction methods: Handles different data formats and column structures

3. Improved Class Imbalance Handling

Increased default minimum samples per class from 5 to 10
Automatically reduces threshold if no classes meet the requirement
Better SMOTE implementation with dynamic k_neighbors parameter
Graceful fallback when SMOTE fails

4. More Robust Error Handling

Handles cases where stratified splitting fails
Manages zero-variance features properly
Better exception handling throughout the pipeline
More informative error messages

5. Enhanced Data Preprocessing

Cleans target column by removing generic values like "Associated Disease"
Handles text data by splitting on multiple delimiters
Converts categorical features to binary appropriately
Processes numeric features with proper missing value handling

Usage:
bash# Train with your dataset
python fixed_script.py --train --dataset good.csv --model_type xgboost --min_samples 5

# If that fails, try with even lower threshold
python fixed_script.py --train --dataset good.csv --model_type xgboost --min_samples 2
What the System Will Do Now:

Analyze your dataset structure to understand what columns contain
Extract meaningful features from whatever data format you have
Handle the extreme class imbalance by filtering appropriately
Use text-based features if structured symptom data isn't available
Train a model that can actually work with your data

The system will now work even with datasets that have:

Unstructured text data
Extreme class imbalance
Missing symptom columns
Various data formats

Try running this fixed version with your dataset and let me know what happens!

# Train with your dataset
python fixed_script.py --train --dataset good.csv --model_type xgboost --min_samples 5

# If that fails, try with even lower threshold
python fixed_script.py --train --dataset good.csv --model_type xgboost --min_samples 2
