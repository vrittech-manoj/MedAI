PubMedBERT Training Pipeline - Sequential Steps
Step 1: Environment Setup

Install transformers library
Download PubMedBERT base model from Hugging Face
Set up GPU environment (CUDA compatible)
Install required dependencies (torch, sklearn, pandas)

Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Load and Clean Dataset:

Read CSV with pandas
Handle missing values in symptom columns
Remove duplicate entries by ID

Text Combination Strategy:

Concatenate all symptom columns (symptoms_1 to symptoms_9)
Add description field
Add symptoms_description
Add causes_description
Format: "Symptoms: [combined_symptoms]. Description: [description]. Additional: [symptoms_description]"

Label Processing:

Extract unique disease names
Create label encoding dictionary
Convert diseases_name to numerical labels
Handle multi-class classification setup

Step 3: Text Standardization
Medical Term Normalization:

Convert abbreviations to full terms
Standardize symptom terminology
Remove special characters and extra spaces
Convert to lowercase
Handle negations properly

Input Length Management:

Tokenize with PubMedBERT tokenizer
Set maximum sequence length (512 tokens)
Truncate or pad sequences as needed

Step 4: Dataset Splitting
Stratified Split:

70% training data
15% validation data
15% test data
Maintain disease distribution across splits
Ensure each disease appears in all splits

Step 5: Data Augmentation
Symptom Variation:

Create synonym replacements for common symptoms
Generate negation examples
Paraphrase symptom descriptions
Create partial symptom combinations
Balance rare disease classes through oversampling

Step 6: Model Configuration
Load PubMedBERT:

Load pre-trained PubMedBERT-base model
Add classification head for number of disease classes
Freeze early layers, unfreeze last 2-3 layers initially

Training Configuration:

Learning rate: 2e-5
Batch size: 16 (adjust based on GPU memory)
Weight decay: 0.01
Warmup steps: 500
Max epochs: 4

Step 7: Loss Function Setup
Handle Class Imbalance:

Calculate class weights from training data
Use weighted CrossEntropyLoss
Monitor both accuracy and F1-score
Set up early stopping on validation loss

Step 8: Training Process
Training Loop:

Train for 1 epoch with frozen layers
Unfreeze all layers
Continue training with lower learning rate (1e-5)
Monitor validation metrics every epoch
Save best model based on validation F1-score

Validation Monitoring:

Calculate accuracy per epoch
Calculate macro and micro F1-scores
Track per-class performance
Monitor for overfitting signs

Step 9: Model Evaluation
Test Set Evaluation:

Load best saved model
Evaluate on held-out test set
Generate classification report
Create confusion matrix
Calculate precision, recall, F1 for each disease

Performance Analysis:

Identify poorly performing disease classes
Analyze misclassifications
Check for data quality issues
Document accuracy metrics

Step 10: Model Optimization
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Adjust learning rate if needed
Modify batch size for better performance
Experiment with different sequence lengths
Test different layer freezing strategies

Final Validation:

Run 5-fold cross-validation
Calculate average performance metrics
Ensure consistent results across folds
Document final model performance

Step 11: Model Saving
Export Trained Model:

Save model weights and configuration
Save tokenizer settings
Save label encoder mapping
Create model inference script
Document input format requirements

Expected Results:

Accuracy: 88-95%
Training time: 2-4 hours on GPU
Model size: ~440MB
Inference speed: <100ms per prediction
